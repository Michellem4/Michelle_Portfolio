# Project#1: California Wildfire Risk Prediction

This project leverages machine learning to **predict wildfire risks** in California using historical wildfire incidents and meteorological data. The goal is to support prevention efforts by accurately identifying high-risk conditions and minimizing false negatives. # including that individual role that I took in the project 


### Machine Learning Models

- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Linear Regression (for exploratory purposes)


### Results

- Achieved high accuracy (93%) in wildfire risk classification
- Created scalable and automated pipelines
- Produced interpretable results for public policy and environmental agencies

# Project 2: Impact of Race on Social Mobility
This project analyzes economic and demographic data to explore racial disparities in intergenerational income mobility in the U.S., with a focus on how father presence in single- and two-parent families influences children's future earnings—particularly among low-income racial groups. The process involved cleaning and preprocessing large-scale datasets, handling missing data, engineering features related to family structure and neighborhood context, and conducting exploratory data analysis to uncover key patterns. These insights guided the development of predictive models and aim to inform social policies that promote upward mobility and reduce racial income inequality.


## Models Used:
 - Linear Regression
 - Lasso & Ridge Regression
 - ElasticNet
 - Random Forest
 - Gradient Boosting



## Results 
 -  Found significant racial disparities in upward income mobility, particularly for Black men, regardless of parental income.
 -  Identified key predictors of economic success: neighborhood poverty level, presence of both parents, and systemic labor market discrimination.
 -  Demonstrated that Black children raised in low-poverty, high-opportunity neighborhoods have substantially better income outcomes.

# Project #3 : Spam or Email 
For this project I developed a logistic regression-based classifier to distinguish spam from legitimate emails using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The workflow involved text preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning on a labeled dataset of 1,000 emails. Key features included character and word counts, punctuation usage, HTML content detection, and other structural elements of emails. These were used to train and optimize a logistic regression model using GridSearchCV. The model achieved strong performance and was evaluated using multiple classification metrics to ensure reliability across different types of email content.

## Models Used:
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Regression
- Natural language processing techniques

## Results:
Developed a logistic regression-based email classifier to distinguish spam from non-spam messages using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Extracted and engineered advanced text features—including character counts, punctuation usage, and HTML tag patterns—to enhance predictive power. Applied GridSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters, resulting in a model accuracy of 91% on a 1,000-row dataset. Evaluated performance using precision, recall, and F1-score, and identified optimization areas to improve robustness and classification reliability.
