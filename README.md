# 🔥 Project#1: California Wildfire Risk Prediction

This project leverages machine learning to **predict wildfire risks** in California using historical wildfire incidents and meteorological data. The goal is to support prevention efforts by accurately identifying high-risk conditions and minimizing false negatives.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Problem**: Wildfires in California are increasingly destructive. Early risk prediction can improve resource allocation and save lives.
- **Solution**: Built predictive models using weather and wildfire history to identify high-risk scenarios before wildfires occur.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
- **Linear Regression (for exploratory purposes)**

**Best Model Accuracy**: `0.93`

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identified key predictors like:
  - 🌡️ Temperature  
  - 🌧️ Precipitation  
  - 💨 Wind Speed  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used grid search and cross-validation to optimize model performance.
- **False Negative Minimization**: Prioritized catching true wildfire risks over general accuracy.

## 🔄 Data Pipeline

- Preprocessed large wildfire and meteorological datasets
- Integrated live weather data via external APIs
- Automated model retraining to keep predictions up to date

---



## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Weather APIs
- Git for version control




## ✅ Results

- Achieved high accuracy (93%) in wildfire risk classification
- Created scalable and automated pipelines
- Produced interpretable results for public policy and environmental agencies
