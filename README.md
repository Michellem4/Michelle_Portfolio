# Project#1: California Wildfire Risk Prediction

This project leverages machine learning to **predict wildfire risks** in California using historical wildfire incidents and meteorological data. The goal is to support prevention efforts by accurately identifying high-risk conditions and minimizing false negatives.


### Machine Learning Models

- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Linear Regression (for exploratory purposes)



### Results

- Achieved high accuracy (93%) in wildfire risk classification
- Created scalable and automated pipelines
- Produced interpretable results for public policy and environmental agencies

## Project 2: Impact of Race on Social Mobility
This project analyzes economic and demographic data to explore racial disparities in intergenerational income mobility in the U.S., with a focus on how father presence in single- and two-parent families influences children's future earningsâ€”particularly among low-income racial groups. The process involved cleaning and preprocessing large-scale datasets, handling missing data, engineering features related to family structure and neighborhood context, and conducting exploratory data analysis to uncover key patterns. These insights guided the development of predictive models and aim to inform social policies that promote upward mobility and reduce racial income inequality.


## Models Used:
 - Linear Regression
 - Lasso & Ridge Regression
 - ElasticNet
 - Random Forest
 - Gradient Boosting



## Results 
 -  Found significant racial disparities in upward income mobility, particularly for Black men, regardless of parental income.
 -  Identified key predictors of economic success: neighborhood poverty level, presence of both parents, and systemic labor market discrimination.
 -  Demonstrated that Black children raised in low-poverty, high-opportunity neighborhoods have substantially better income outcomes.

### Project #3 : Spam or Email 
For this project I developed a logistic regression-based classifier to detect spam emails using natural language processing (NLP). The project focused on transforming raw email text into meaningful features for accurate classificatio
